# Battery_Data_Challenge

This repository contains my project submission for the ACCURE Battery Data Challenge. It includes comprehensive analysis and visualization of three distinct battery datasets. The key steps performed in the analysis include:

1. **Data Import and Preparation**: Functions were created to import .csv files into Pandas dataframes, handle missing values, and preprocess the data for further analysis.

2. **Battery State Analysis**:
    - Identifying charging, discharging, and idle states of the batteries.
    - Handling missing values and outliers in the datasets.
    - Visualizing current, voltage, and temperature data over time.

3. **Cell Chemistry Identification**: Determining the likely cell chemistry of each battery based on voltage and temperature profiles.

4. **System Configuration**: Estimating the number of cells in each battery system based on capacity and voltage.

5. **Data Visualization**: Creating various plots to illustrate the states and characteristics of the batteries.

This project demonstrates practical techniques in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, which can be beneficial for anyone working with large datasets, particularly in the context of battery performance analysis.
